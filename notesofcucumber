Feature File:
	
	Feature file are document that contain gherkin Scenario and Requirement. Each Scenario act as test case.
	
	* It should be declarative(only specifying what needs to be accomplished)
	
	* Avoid UI action steps
	
	* Avoid conjunctive steps 	
			Sticking to one action per step more modular and reusable.
			conciseness, scenario titles should focus on what the behavior is.
			 The why can either be deduced from the steps or made plain with comments.
	
	* Use Background
		to use the same step at the beginning of all scenarios of a feature
	
	* Limit the number of scenario per feature.
	
	* Limit the number of steps per scenario
	
	* Avoid gigantic table
	
	* Scenario should be short or sweet.
	 
	* write scenarios defensively so that changes in the underlying data do not cause test runs to fail
	
	* 1.Given-When-Then steps must appear in order and cannot repeat. 
	  2.Any single When-Then pair denotes an individual behavior. 
	  3.One scenario covers one behavior.	
	  
	* Avoid assertion language.  
			
	*  Givens set up initial state, Whens perform an action, and Then verify outcomes.
	
StepDefination:

	A step definition is a code block that implements the logic to execute a Scenario step.
	
Runner Class:

	* class use to execute the feature file n step definition class
	
	* @RunWith() - to tells the JUnit that test should run using Cucumber class.
	
	* @CucumberOption - This class just needs annotations to understand that cucumber features would
	  be run through it and you can specify feature files to be picked up plus the steps package location
	  		
	  		Cucumber Options are:
	  			
	  		features: set the paths of the feature file
	  		dryRun: Check if all the steps have the Step definition(by default value false)
	  		glues: set The path of step definition file
	  		tags: What tags in the feature file should be executed
			monochrome: Display the console output in much readable way(by default value false)
			format: What all report format to use
			Strict: Will fail execution if there are undefined or pending steps.(by default value false)
